Practice with loops for repetitive tasks

I created this table for my daughter so she has a reference when she needs it. It was a good exercise and even a bit of fun to create!

There is a version for Excel that can be downloaded or a php script that can be run. Do with them what you will!

For Karee. Because: MATH!
